# Product Overview: Submoda

## What is Submoda?

Submoda is a production-grade submodular optimization platform implemented in Rust for large-scale subset selection problems. It provides provably optimal algorithms with (1-1/e) ≈ 0.632 approximation guarantees for selecting representative subsets from massive datasets.

## Core Problem

**Subset Selection with Provable Quality:**

Given a ground set of n candidates and an objective function measuring subset quality, find k elements that maximize the objective while satisfying constraints. Submoda solves this NP-hard problem efficiently using submodular optimization with provable approximation guarantees.

**Example Use Cases:**
- **Data Summarization**: Select 100 representative images from 1 million photos
- **Sensor Placement**: Choose optimal locations for 50 sensors from 10,000 candidates
- **Feature Selection**: Pick 20 most informative features from 1,000 variables
- **Document Summarization**: Extract 10 key sentences from 1,000-page corpus
- **Influence Maximization**: Select 500 seed users from 1 million to maximize viral spread

## Core Features

### Objective Functions
- **Facility Location**: Coverage optimization with weighted demand points
- **Saturating Coverage**: Concave saturation functions (log, sqrt, threshold)
- **Log-Determinant**: Diversity via Determinantal Point Processes (DPP)
- **Extensible Framework**: Custom objective functions via trait implementation

### Optimization Algorithms
- **Lazy Greedy**: Epoch-based optimization reducing evaluations by 90-95%
- **Stochastic Greedy**: O(n log 1/ε) complexity for massive-scale problems
- **Continuous Greedy**: Handles complex matroid constraints
- **Sieve-Streaming**: Single-pass streaming for online scenarios

### Constraint Systems
- **Cardinality**: |S| ≤ k (select exactly k elements)
- **Knapsack**: Budget constraints with cost functions
- **Partition Matroid**: Per-category capacity limits
- **Graphic Matroid**: Acyclicity constraints for graph problems

### Production Features
- **Thread-Safe Parallelism**: Immutable oracle pattern enables safe concurrent evaluation
- **Deterministic Execution**: Reproducible results across runs and platforms
- **Numerical Stability**: 5-layer defense for Log-Determinant computations
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and JSON Lines audit logs
