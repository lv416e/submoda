# Specification Quality Checklist: Submodular Optimization Platform (submoda)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Pass âœ“

All checklist items passed. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

**Key Strengths**:

1. **Comprehensive Requirements**: 36 functional requirements covering all aspects (algorithms, objectives, constraints, I/O, stability, determinism, monitoring, thread safety, termination)
2. **Measurable Success Criteria**: 15 technology-agnostic success criteria with specific numeric targets (63% approximation, <10 minutes completion, 0% hash collision, etc.)
3. **Clear Scope Boundaries**: Detailed "In Scope" and "Out of Scope" sections explicitly exclude non-monotone algorithms, distributed computing, GPU acceleration, etc.
4. **Risk Analysis**: Comprehensive risk assessment covering technical, operational, schedule, and dependency risks with concrete mitigations
5. **User-Centric**: 5 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) with independent testability and clear value propositions
6. **Edge Cases**: 7 specific edge cases addressed with explicit system behavior
7. **Assumptions Documented**: 15 assumptions covering hardware, data format, numerical properties, licensing

**No Clarifications Needed**: Specification contains no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all decisions made with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section.

## Notes

- Specification extracted WHAT (capabilities) and WHY (approximation guarantees, reliability, reproducibility) from technical document
- Requirements are implementation-agnostic: no mention of Rust, specific crate APIs, or code structures
- Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes (completion time, approximation quality, determinism) not internal metrics
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning
