//! Efficient Parquet/Arrow data loading and sparse matrix construction.
//!
//! ## Currently Implemented
//!
//! This crate is in initial setup phase. No I/O functionality is implemented yet.
//!
//! ## Planned (TODO)
//!
//! The following features will be implemented in future tasks:
//! - Parquet reader with predicate pushdown and row-group optimization (Task 4.x)
//! - CSR/CSC sparse matrix construction from triplets (Task 4.x)
//! - Hash-based sharding for parallel loading (Task 4.x)
//! - Async prefetching for streaming scenarios (Task 4.x)
